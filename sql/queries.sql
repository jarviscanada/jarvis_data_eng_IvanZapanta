--- MODIFYING DATA ---

---Question 1:
---The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values:
---facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
---Solution:
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance
)
VALUES
    (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);


---Question 2:
---Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:
---Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
---Solution:
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (
    facid,
    name,
    membercost,
    guestcost,
    initialoutlay,
    monthlymaintenance
)
SELECT
        (SELECT MAX(facid) FROM cd.facilities) + 1,
        'Spa',
        20,
        30,
        100000,
        800;


---Question 3:
We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error.
---Solution:
UPDATE cd.facilities
SET initialoutlay = 10000
WHERE facid = 1;


---Question 4:
---We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.
---Solution:
UPDATE cd.facilities facs
SET
    membercost = (SELECT membercost * 1.1 FROM cd.facilities WHERE facid = 0),
    guestcost = (SELECT guestcost * 1.1 FROM cd.facilities WHERE facid = 0)
WHERE facs.facid = 1;


---Question 5:
---As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from the cd.bookings table. How can we accomplish this?
---Solution:
DELETE FROM cd.bookings;
TRUNCATE cd.bookings;


---Question 6:
---We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. How can we achieve that?
Solution:
DELETE FROM cd.members;
WHERE memid = 37;
