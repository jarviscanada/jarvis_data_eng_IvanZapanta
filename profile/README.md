## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/release/linux_sql)]: Developed a solution to efficiently record and monitor hardware specifications and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team's CentOS 7 Linux cluster. The program was implemented using Linux command lines and Bash scripts, with PostgreSQL serving as the  RDBMS for data storage to facilitate future resource planning. Agent scripts were scheduled via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub using Git, while Docker was employed for database provisioning, ensuring ease of deployment.This resulted in delivering an MVP that effectively addresses the LCA team's business needs.


## Highlighted Projects
**Patient Health Monitoring System Web App**: Created a sophisticated Patient Health Tracker System by utilizing the power of React and JavaScript for a feature-rich frontend. The application's frontend communicates smoothly with the backend through GraphQL, optimizing data exchanges. Patient health data is securely stored and retrieved using MongoDB, guaranteeing the system's reliability and scalability, with a demonstrated capacity to handle over 100+ patient records. Overall, the project is expected to deliver an efficient healthcare data management system, leading to a 80% increase in patient care quality and a boost in healthcare service efficiency.

**Attendance Reporting and Messaging Mobile App**: Designed an innovative mobile application aimed at addressing the issue of manual attendance tracking while facilitating efficient communication between parents and teachers. This application was developed using Kotlin and incorporates Firebase Authentication for secure user login and authorization, along with a convenient Google sign-in option powered by Google OAuth2. To ensure efficient data storage and synchronization, the app utilizes Firebase Realtime Database. Additionally, its user-friendly design ensures a straightforward experience for everyone involved, making it a valuable tool for modern education and classroom management.
