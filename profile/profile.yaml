    description: "Developed a solution to efficiently record and monitor hardware specifications and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team's CentOS 7 Linux cluster. The program was implemented using Linux command lines and Bash scripts, with PostgreSQL serving as the  RDBMS for data storage to facilitate future resource planning. Agent scripts were scheduled via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub using Git, while Docker was employed for database provisioning, ensuring ease of deployment.This resulted in delivering an MVP that effectively addresses the LCA team's business needs."
