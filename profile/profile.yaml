# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/linux_sql"
    description: "Developed a solution to track hardware specs and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. The solution used Bash scripts for implementation, with PostgreSQL as the database. Agent scripts ran via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub with Git. Docker was used for database provisioning, making deployment easier. This resulted in an MVP that successfully met the LCA team's needs."
  - name: "RDBMS and SQL"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/sql"
    description: "Completed a series of SQL queries using PostgreSQL for learning purposes, focusing on developing and demonstrating my SQL proficiency."
  - name: "Grep App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/grep"
    description: "Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory. It supports recursive searching and allows users to specify an output file for results. The project used Java, Java Stream and IO APIs for data processing, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. This created a powerful, user-friendly tool for managing text data."
  - name: "Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc"
    description: "Created an application that allows users to fetch real-time stock quote data, buy and sell stocks, and manage their portfolios and current positions. It uses JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database for performing CRUD operations. The latest stock data is retrieved from the Alpha Vantage API, ensuring up-to-date information for users. This application provides an efficient way for users to manage their investments and stay updated with market changes."
