# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/linux_sql"
    description: "Developed a solution to track hardware specs and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. The solution used Bash scripts for implementation, with PostgreSQL as the database. Agent scripts ran via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub with Git. Docker was used for database provisioning, making deployment easier. This resulted in an MVP that successfully met the LCA team's needs."
  - name: "RDBMS and SQL"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/sql"
    description: "Completed series of SQL queries through practice exercise using PostgreSQL. The exercises covered various SQL concepts, including basic queries, JOIN operations, aggregation, and string manipulation. Overall, the project helped me enhanced my SQL proficiency by solving different query challenges."
  - name: "Grep App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/grep"
    description: "Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory. It supports recursive searching and allows users to specify an output file for results. The project used Java, Java Stream and IO APIs for data processing, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. This created a powerful, user-friendly tool for managing text data."
  - name: "Stock Quote App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc"
    description: "Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory.
