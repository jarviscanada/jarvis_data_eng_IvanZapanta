The app is built with Kotlin and, to ensure secure logins, it uses Firebase Authentication, including an easy Google sign-in option through Google OAuth2. Additionally, it stores and syncs data using Firebase Realtime Database. Overall, the app is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a helpful tool for modern classrooms and education management.",

The solution used Bash scripts for implementation, with PostgreSQL as the database. Agent scripts ran via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub with Git. Docker was used for database provisioning, making deployment easier. This resulted in an MVP that successfully met the LCA team's needs.",
