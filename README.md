## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: Developed a solution to track hardware specs and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. The solution used Bash scripts for implementation, with PostgreSQL as the database. Agent scripts ran via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub with Git. Docker was used for database provisioning, making deployment easier. This resulted in an MVP that successfully met the LCA team's needs.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/sql)]: Completed series of SQL queries through practice exercise using PostgreSQL. The exercises covered various SQL concepts, including basic queries, JOIN operations, aggregation, and string manipulation. Overall, the project helped me enhanced my SQL proficiency by solving different query challenges.

**Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/grep)]: Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory. It supports recursive searching and allows users to specify an output file for results. The project used Java, Java Stream and IO APIs for data processing, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. This created a powerful, user-friendly tool for managing text data.

**Stock Quote App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc)]: Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory. It supports recursive searching and allows users to specify an output file for results. The project used Java, Java Stream and IO APIs for data processing, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. This created a powerful, user-friendly tool for managing text data.


## Highlighted Projects
**Patient Health Tracker App**: Developed a health tracking application using React and JavaScript for an easy-to-use frontend which connects smoothly with the backend through GraphQL to exchange data efficiently. Additionally, the patient health data is stored securely in MongoDB, ensuring the system is both reliable and capable of handling over 100 patient records. This app is designed to improve patient care by 80% and make healthcare services more efficient.

**Portfolio Website**: Developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional achievements. The website is built with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS with a focus on clean, responsive design. It includes sections for project overviews, about, skills and link icons. The site is hosted on Vercel, and it emphasizes responsive design, user experience, and accessibility, making it easy for potential viewers to explore my work.


## Professional Experiences
