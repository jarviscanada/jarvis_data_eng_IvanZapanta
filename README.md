I am a software developer who enjoys solving problems and turning ideas into  effective solutions. With a strong academic background in software engineering, I have worked on projects using frontend technologies like React and Angular, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB, focusing on creating smooth and responsive websites. Some of my key projects include a health tracker app, weather app, todo app, and a portfolio website, each designed with intuitive interfaces and functionality to enhance user experience and engagement. My goal is to create innovative, engaging, and accessible digital experiences while continuously growing and contributing meaningfully to each project I undertake.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: Developed a solution to track hardware specs and real-time resource usage for the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team. The solution used Bash scripts for implementation, with PostgreSQL as the database. Agent scripts ran via cron, and the source code was managed on GitHub with Git. Docker was used for database provisioning, making deployment easier. This resulted in an MVP that successfully met the LCA team's needs.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/sql)]: Completed a series of SQL queries using PostgreSQL for learning purposes, focusing on developing and demonstrating my SQL proficiency.

**Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/grep)]: Developed a Java-based Grep application, similar to Linux's grep command, for searching regular expression patterns within a root directory. It supports recursive searching and allows users to specify an output file for results. The project used Java, Java Stream and IO APIs for data processing, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. This created a powerful, user-friendly tool for managing text data.

**Stock Quote App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_IvanZapanta/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc)]: Created an application that allows users to fetch real-time stock quote data, buy and sell stocks, and manage their portfolios and current positions. It uses JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database for performing CRUD operations. The latest stock data is retrieved from the Alpha Vantage API, ensuring up-to-date information for users. This application provides an efficient way for users to manage their investments and stay updated with market changes.


## Highlighted Projects
**Patient Health Tracker App**: Developed a health tracking application using React and JavaScript for an easy-to-use frontend which connects smoothly with the backend through GraphQL to exchange data efficiently. Additionally, the patient health data is stored securely in MongoDB, ensuring the system is both reliable and capable of handling over 100 patient records. This app is designed to improve patient care by 80% and make healthcare services more efficient.

**Portfolio Website**: Developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional achievements. The website is built with React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS with a focus on clean, responsive design. It includes sections for project overviews, about, skills and link icons. The site is hosted on Vercel, and it emphasizes responsive design, user experience, and accessibility, making it easy for potential viewers to explore my work.


## Professional Experiences
